# ChowTrackr


## What is ChowTrackr?
### ChowTrackr is a fully responsive website created to ease the process of ordering food for large groups of people! Often times at work, when ordering though delivery apps such as DoorDash or UberEats, it can be a hassel to gather orders, relay delivery times, payment information!
With ChowTrackr, having all of the information in one place allows all members to quickly input their order's (however complicated they may be) into the Order Trackr. A designated user can then input all of the orders into the delivery app of their choice and update payment and delivery information.
There is no more need to create separate text chains or pass around a phone to relay information multiple times!

## What was the inspiration?
We would on many occasions order lunch during office hours for > 7 people. More than often, this would cause disruption to the workflow as it would take much time to gather all orders and creating group chats to relay redundant information multiple times. It was always a burden and no one wanted to be designated with the task of inputting and gathering all the orders. With ChowTrackr, the time and efficiency of this process has dramatically improved!
